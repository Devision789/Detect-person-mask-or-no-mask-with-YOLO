# Detect-person-mask-or-no-mask-with-YOLO
# Overview

This repository contains the code for detecting face masks in real-time using the YOLOv8 object detection framework. 
YOLOv8 is a powerful and efficient object detection model that can be used to detect a wide variety of objects, including faces and masks.

# Features

Real-time face mask detection using YOLOv8
Pre-trained YOLOv8 model for face mask detection
Custom YOLOv8 model training for improved accuracy
Visualization of detected faces and masks
# Installation
1. Clone myrepo
   
2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run main.py
# Data

The dataset used in this project is the Face Mask Detection Dataset from Kaggle. 
The dataset contains images of people with and without masks.

# Model

best.pt
if you need code train model pls contact to me
# Visualization

The detected faces and masks are visualized using OpenCV. 
The visualization shows the bounding boxes around the detected faces and masks, as well as the confidence scores for each detection.

# Usage

To use the pre-trained model to detect face masks in real-time, you can call the main.py script. 
The script takes the path to the video file or the webcam index as input.

# Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world applications. 
Face mask detection can be a challenging task, and the accuracy of the detections may vary depending on the lighting conditions, the angle of the face, and other factors.
